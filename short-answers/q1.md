# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - Reads 
    GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used to request data

2. POST - Creates: 
    POST method sends data to the server

3. PUT/PATCH - Update: 
    PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource. Considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. 
    PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.
        
    The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), whereas successive identical POST requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.

4. DELETE - Delete/ Remove
    DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.
